What plans do I have? 
The roadmap of DJSEAMT


Webserver stores data during handshake (hello.php)
Data stored:
- uuid
- hostname
- timestamp when uuid was generated
- timestamp of first contact (never changed in the future)
- timestamp of last contact (changed every time a handshake occurs)
- client version of last contact


Client holds more configuration files
- all files stored in the client configuration directory
- client chooses 'best' file
- files have an expiration and/or begin date
- failback to next 'best' config file when server cannot be reached


Client receives new configuration files from server


Job execution
- client ask for a job
- client executes job
- client sends feedback about running/ended job


Job scheduling
- external program (server) provides job plans
- webserver distributes jobs to clients


Encrypted data transfer between client and webserver
- using HTTPS
- using self-made certificates


Oh yes, a lot of work to do...
