What plans do I have? 
The roadmap of DJSEAMT


Webserver stores data during handshake (hello.php)
Data stored:
- uuid [done]
- hostname [done]
- timestamp when uuid was generated
- timestamp of first contact (never changed in the future) [done]
- timestamp of last contact (changed every time a handshake occurs) [done]
- client version of last contact [done]


Client holds more configuration files
- all files stored in the client configuration directory [done]
- client chooses 'best' file
- files have an expiration and/or begin date
- failback to next 'best' config file when server cannot be reached [done: sorted by priority value]


Client runs as daemon
- unless requested by command line option (--foreground or something)
- regular handshake (specified in master config file, overwritten by subconfig file, overwritten by server option)
- trying to contact server for handshake in an endless loop


Client writes log file
- verbosity can be set
- destination set in master configuration file
- describe method of log rotation (done by client or logrotate daemon?)


Client receives new configuration files from server
- server offers list of subconfig files
- client requests missing subconfig files


Exchanged information
- each client holds its own properties file, which is transferred to the server and stored (could be useful for queries)


Job execution
- client ask for a job
- client executes job
- client sends feedback about running/ended job


Job scheduling
- external program (server) provides job plans
- webserver distributes jobs to clients


Encrypted data transfer between client and webserver
- using HTTPS
- using self-made certificates


Oh yes, a lot of work to do...
