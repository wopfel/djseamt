About:
  DJSEAMT is a Distributed Job Scheduling Environment And Management Tool.
  There are two parts: one distributed piece of software (client) and a server component.

Why?
  I'd like to create a tool where I can collect the computers' data to one central place
  and schedule jobs when they are powered on the next time.
  Example: check what type of hard disks are installed
  Another example: install vim-full the next time the computer is powered on

How it should work some time (client):
  1. Parse command line args
  2. Read config file
  3. <configdir>/id file missing? Generate one with a GUID, set creation date and time (timestamp)
     Read <configdir>/id file
  4. Handshake with server
     http://.../hello.php
  5. A job for me?
     http://.../request-job.php
  6. Feedback
     http://.../feedback.php

How it should work some time (server):
  1. Wait for contact
  2. Serve jobs, get feedback, store data
