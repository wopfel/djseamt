About:
  DJSEAMT is a Distributed Job Scheduling Environment And Management Tool.
  There are two parts: one distributed piece of software (client) and a server component.

Why?
  I'd like to create a tool where I can collect the computers' data to one central place
  and schedule jobs when they are powered on the next time.
  Example: check what type of hard disks are installed
  Another example: install vim-full the next time the computer is powered on

How it should work some time (client):
  1. Parse command line args
  2. Read config file
  3. <configdir>/id file missing? Generate one with a GUID, set creation date and time (timestamp)
     Read <configdir>/id file
  4. Handshake with server
     http://.../hello.php
  5. A job for me?
     http://.../request-job.php
  6. Feedback
     http://.../feedback.php

How it should work some time (server):
  1. Wait for contact
  2. Serve jobs, get feedback, store data

Setup (so far):
  1. Install dependencies for the client script (see "use ..." lines at the beginning) so it can be called without error messages from Perl
     At least (names for Ubuntu 10.10): libuuid-tiny-perl libconfig-inifiles-perl
  2. Copy config-client.sample to config-client (or something similar), edit the new file
     Modify value of configdir, a readable/writeable directory for the user that runs the script
     Copy subconfig.sample to subconfig-0001-test and place the file in the specified configdir
     Modify contact_url to point to your webserver and path in file subconfig-0001-test
  3. Store content of src-web in the path you specified in the client
  4. Create a MySQL database, table (see file tools/mysql-database.sql) and user with password, grant access to the database
  5. Copy config-sample.php to config.php on your webserver and adjust config.php
  6. Run djseamt-client -c CONFIGFILE
     An id file is created in the configdir
     Client tries to contact the webserver
     If everything works fine, you'll see some lines between "Response follows:" and "Response ends." and an entry in the database table is created
